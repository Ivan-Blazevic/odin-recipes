### Project: Recipes

The goal of this project is to practice and review all the HTML that I have learned about up to this point. In this project I'm going to build a basic recipe site using only HTML. I hope to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML tags like unordered and ordered lists, paragraphs, headers, etc.
